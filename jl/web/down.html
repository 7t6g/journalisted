<h2>Journalisted is currently down for maintenance.</h2>
<p>
We were a little surprised (and pleased) at the huge amount of interest generated 
during what was meant to be a very low key beta-test period.
</p>
<p>
There are a few gaps in our automatic data-collection system that we are sorting out,
as well as adding sources (like news blogs) which weren't included. Until that's
done, we're taking the site down to avoid being unfair on those journalists who
haven't been credited with all the articles they should have been.
</p>
<p>
Such an automatic system is never going to be 100% perfect, but we want 
to make it as accurate as we can.
</p>
<p>
The site should be back up and running next week.
