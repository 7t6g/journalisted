This directory holds changes to be applied to the live database.
After a change has been applied, the sql file should be moved into the
"applied" dir. There is currently no master schema file maintained.

schema.sql is a dump of the database schema, which may or may not be up to
date :-)
basedata.sql is a dump of just the organisation table, which the scrapers
need.

All these notes assume your database is called 'mst' and there is a database
user also called 'mst'.

Text is utf-8 encoded and stored in a latin-1 DB. So the DB _thinks_ it's
got latin-1 text, but the backend and website know that that text is really
in utf-8). At some point we'll tidy it up so the database knows it's storing
utf-8.


To restore from a backup:

Kill the old db:
  $ dropdb mst

Create the new one:
  $ createdb -E latin-1 -U mst mst

as a database superuser:
  CREATE TRUSTED PROCEDURAL LANGUAGE plpgsql HANDLER plpgsql_call_handler VALIDATOR plpgsql_validator;

eg:
  $ sudo -u postgres psql
  postgres=# CREATE TRUSTED PROCEDURAL LANGUAGE plpgsql HANDLER plpgsql_call_handler VALIDATOR plpgsql_validator;
  postgres=# \q


Load backup:

  $ bzcat [backupfile] | psql -U mst mst
