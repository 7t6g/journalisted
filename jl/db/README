This directory holds changes to be applied to the live database.
After a change has been applied, the sql file should be moved into the
"applied" dir. There is currently no master schema file maintained.

schema.sql is a dump of the database schema, which may or may not be up to
date :-)
basedata.sql is a dump of just the organisation table, which the scrapers
need.

All these notes assume your database is called 'mst' and there is a database
user also called 'mst'.
To create mst user:
  $ sudo -u postgres createuser --no-superuser --no-createrole --createdb mst


Text is utf-8 encoded and stored in an ascii DB. So the DB _thinks_ it's
got ascii text, but the backend and website know that that text is really
in utf-8). At some point we'll tidy it up so the database knows it's storing
utf-8.


To restore from a backup or initialize fresh database:

(Windows users should use "psql -U postgres" as an Administrator wherever
"sudo -u postgres psql" appears.)

Kill the old db:
  $ dropdb -U mst mst

Create the new one:
  $ createdb -U mst -E sql_ascii mst

Allow PL/PgSQL stored procedures:
  $ sudo -u postgres psql -c "CREATE TRUSTED PROCEDURAL LANGUAGE plpgsql HANDLER plpgsql_call_handler VALIDATOR plpgsql_validator;" mst

To initialize database:
  $ psql -U mst mst -f jl/db/schema.sql
  $ psql -U mst mst -f jl/db/basedata.sql

Load backup:
  $ bzcat [backupfile] | psql -U mst mst
or if you have a password set on the mst user:
  $ bzcat [backupfile] > /tmp/blah  &&  psql -U mst mst -f /tmp/blah  &&  rm /tmp/blah


Postgres 8.3 notes
------------------

- can no longer create DBs which have encoding other than what the cluster uses.
- can turn this off by settings locale to POSIX (or C):
sudo pg_createcluster --locale POSIX 8.3 main
- alternative is to use "sql_ascii" encoding when creating the database with
  createdb (as specified above)
