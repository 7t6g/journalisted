This directory holds changes to be applied to the live database.
After a change has been applied, the sql file should be moved into the
"applied" dir. There is currently no master schema file maintained.


Text is utf-8 encoded and stored in a latin-1 DB. So the DB _thinks_ it's
got latin-1 text, but the backend and website know that that text is really
in utf-8). At some point we'll tidy it up so the database knows it's storing
utf-8.


To restore from a backup:

Kill the old db:
  $ dropdb mst

Create the new one:
  $ createdb -E latin-1 mst

as superuser:

  CREATE TRUSTED PROCEDURAL LANGUAGE plpgsql HANDLER plpgsql_call_handler VALIDATOR plpgsql_validator;

Load backup:

  $ bzcat [backupfile] | psql -U mst mst
