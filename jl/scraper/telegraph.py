# Telegraph seems to have three different formats:
# .xml, .html and blogs (.htm).
# The blog ones are done by blogs.py
#
# TODO:
#
# - see if the telegraph update their master rss feed page. Currently the
#   list of feeds is a manually-cobbled-together mix of old and new feeds.
#   At time of writing (2008-07-23) telegraph rss feeds page only lists
#   old-style feeds.
#
# - Some RSS feeds for old-style (xml) sections no longer seem to work. Columists is hard hit, so see FindColumnistArticles() cheesy hack.
#   Remove it when opinion section moves over to new format.
#
# - better sundaytelegraph handling
#
# - tidy URLs ( strip jsessionid etc)
#     http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/main.jhtml?view=DETAILS&grid=&xml=/earth/2007/07/19/easeabird119.xml
#     (strip view param)
#
# - handle multi-page articles (currently only pick up first page) (is this a problem with new website format too?)
