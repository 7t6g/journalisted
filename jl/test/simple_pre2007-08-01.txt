# select distinct byline from article where pubdate < '2007-08-01';
#
# Instructions:
#
# One byline per line.
# Lines beginning with a hash # are comments, ignored by code.
#
# Each 'interesting' part of a byline should be marked by surrounding it
# with square brackets, prefixed with a single letter code to say what
# sort of thing it is:
#
# n Name (of journalist!)
# l Location
# t job Title
# a Agency/organisation (eg "reuters", "the sunday telegraph", "bbc news")
# e Email address
# s Subject/column name (eg "Medical Briefing", "cricket", "dairy", "my week")
#
#
# Example:
#
#  By Adrian Blomfield in Moscow and David Blair, Diplomatic Correspondent
#
# becomes:
#
#  By n[Adrian Blomfield] in l[Moscow] and n[David Blair], t[Diplomatic Correspondent]
#
# If in doubt, you can comment out a line by putting a hash (#) at the start.
# Or you can insert comment lines with notes if you're uncertain about anything:
#
# eg:
#   # is "semprini" a place or an aftershave?
